The Generalized Pochammer-Chree Equations
Since solitary-wave solutions often play a central role in the long-time evolution of an initial disturbance, we consider
such solutions here (via normal form approach) within the framework of reversible systems theory.
On isolated curves in the relevant parameter region, the delocalized waves reduce to genuine embedded solitons.
Directions for future work are also described.
