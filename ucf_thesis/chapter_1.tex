\chapter{CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION} \label{chapter_1}

Chapter and major headings are typically created using the Heading 1 style. They are centered and in all caps. Note that Chapter titles should be formatted and positioned exactly the same as frontmatter and other major headings. However, chapters with subtitles may be stacked, single-spaced, rather than appear on one line.
The Introduction presents an overview of the thesis or dissertation material to be discussed. For sample theses and dissertations, including sample Introductions from your discipline, visit the University Writing Center’s Graduate Gateway, located at \href{http://www.uwc.ucf.edu}{http://www.uwc.ucf.edu}. Please be aware that UWC links are for content samples only, not format samples.

\section{First-level Subheading}

First-level subheadings are centered, typically underlined and occur in upper/lower case letters. In your styles menu, you will usually refer to this as Heading 2.

\subsection{Second-level Subheading}

Second-level Subheadings are usually centered in upper/lower case letters with no additional formatting. These are referred to as Heading 3.

\subsubsection{Third-level Subheading} Acts the same as command \verb|\paragraph|. I do not see any reason to go any deeper with that.
