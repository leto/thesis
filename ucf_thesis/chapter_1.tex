\chapter{CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION} \label{chapter_1}

\section{First-level Subheading}

First-level subheadings are centered, typically underlined and occur in upper/lower case letters. In your styles menu, you will usually refer to this as Heading 2.

\subsection{Second-level Subheading}

Second-level Subheadings are usually centered in upper/lower case letters with no additional formatting. These are referred to as Heading 3.

\subsubsection{Third-level Subheading} Acts the same as command \verb|\paragraph|. I do not see any reason to go any deeper with that.
