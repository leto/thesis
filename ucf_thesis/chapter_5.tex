\chapter{CHAPTER FIVE: CONCLUSION} \label{chapter_5}

Chapter Five, also called ``Summary'', ``Conclusion'' or ``Recommendations'', usually presents a conclusion to the research, offers recommendations to the problem investigated, or discusses implications for future studies.

\section{Bookmarks}

A few words about bookmarks. Frontmatter entries, like the Abstract, Acknowledgments and the Table of Contents should appear in the bookmarks –– but not in the Table of Contents. The TOC contains only pages that appear after the Table of Contents in the document, usually beginning with the List of Figures. So, bookmark and Table of Contents entries do vary.
However, bookmarks should include all major and chapter headings and at least first-level subheadings EXACTLY as they appear in the document (and the TOC). And readers should be able to link to pages within the ETD from all of the bookmarks, the TOC entries, as well as the Lists of Figures and Tables.
