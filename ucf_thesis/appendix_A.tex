\item Begin appendix text on the page following the buffer page
\item Continue Arabic pagination; do not restart page numbering with an appendix
\item Use the same style and format for buffer page headings as you do for other body chapter headings.
\item Letter, don’t number, appendixes (e.g., APPENDIX A, APPENDIX B)
\item If you have only one appendix, do not letter it at all
\item Appendixes should follow the margin and other formatting requirements from the rest of the document

\section{About References}

References appear in the style of your particular reference system. While a hanging indent is preferred, some style guides use alternate formatting.
References should be either double-spaced throughout, with no space between entries, or single-spaced within entries with a double space between.
Below find a sample reference with a hanging indent, formatting along APA style. Here is how to cite:~\cite{Allison_2000}.
