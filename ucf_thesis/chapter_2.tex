Check with your adviser if you aren’t sure about what style your college uses. Some common reference systems include: APA, MLA, IEEE, Chicago and Turabian. For formatting purposes, UCF requires only that you use a reference style properly and consistently, and that you format reference pages according to ETD standards. When in question, UCF formatting requirements supersede all department and reference style requirements.
