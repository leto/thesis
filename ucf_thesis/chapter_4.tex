\chapter{CHAPTER FOUR: FINDINGS} \label{chapter_4}


Chapter Four, also called “Results” or “Data Analysis,” usually provides detailed findings of the research. This chapter is where tables and figures most often appear, so make sure formatting is consistent.

\section{Sample Table}

The following sample table is an example of acceptable table formatting. Descriptive titles appear above tables and may appear either on one line or stacked and single-spaced. The table itself may also be single-spaced as necessary.
If possible, try to keep tables and/or figures all on one page. If necessary, start the table or figure on a new page, even if this means leaving blank space on the preceding page. If you must split a table over multiple pages, repeat the table headings and continue. It is not necessary to repeat the table title.

\section{Sample Figure}

The following is a sample figure with acceptable figure formatting. For figures, be sure you format both the figure and the figure title consistently. This includes placement (centered or left-justified), spacing before and after, line spacing, point size and font.

%% Best way to generate pictures, especially graphs, is to save them (say from MATLB) as .eps (Encapsulated PostScript) and than
%% convert to PDF using (attached) eps2pdf utility. Note that pdfTeX will not accept .eps files.
