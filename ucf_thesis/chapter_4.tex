\chapter{CHAPTER FOUR: RESULTS} \label{chapter_4}

In this thesis, we apply a recently developed technique to
comprehensively categorize all possible families of solitary wave
solutions in two models of topical interest.

The models considered are:
\begin{itemize}
\item the Generalized Pochhammer-Chree Equations, which  govern the propagation of longitudinal waves in elastic rods,

and

\item a generalized microstructure PDE.
\end{itemize}

Limited analytic results exist for the occurrence of one family
of  solitary wave solutions for each of these equations. Since, as
mentioned above, solitary wave solutions often play a central role in
the long-time evolution of an initial disturbance, we consider
such solutions of both models here (via the normal form approach)
within the framework of reversible systems theory.

Besides confirming
the existence of the known family of solitary waves for each model,
we find a continuum of delocalized solitary waves
(or homoclinics to small-amplitude periodic orbits).
On isolated curves in the relevant parameter region, the delocalized
waves reduce to genuine embedded solitons.
For both models, the new family of solutions occur in regions of
parameter space distinct from the known solitary wave solutions and
are thus entirely new.

Directions for future work, including the dynamics of each family of
solitary waves using exponential asymptotics techniques, are also mentioned.
